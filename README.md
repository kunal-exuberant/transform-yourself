# transform-yourself
 Inspiration:- I am aware of the strong feeling among all of us that to have a better habit. Achieve something for yourself. Or to get up early this week.  Evolutionary growth. - We always know that we feel reluctant to complete the work on time.  We sometimes fail to complete the task. We are caught up in some more urgent task which we could not complete in time.  Will report - how many tasks you successfully completed / how many u failed to complete.  This is not a task management app /  Focus of this app is to transform yourself through work.  Basis:- Ted talk - transform through image Google - OKR
